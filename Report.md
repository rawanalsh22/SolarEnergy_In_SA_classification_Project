# Final Report to classification project - Solar Energy in Saudi Arabia

### 1. Abstract

> The Sun is an extremely powerful energy source, and sunlight is by far the largest source of energy received by Earth, but its intensity at Earth’s surface is actually quite low. This is essentially because of the enormous radial spreading of radiation from the distant Sun.With energy costs and consumption rising dramatically, the need for renewable energy has become urgent. 
In line with the Kingdom’s Vision 2030 plan to diversify energy sources.


### 2.Design

> predict about weather, Where is the best location and the best days to work ?

### 3.Data

> Database source is [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/esraamadi/saudi-arabia-weather-history) it is a Medical Cost Personal Datasets, depends on: designation, form of clinic, town of residence, sex, age and if this person smoker or not, and do have children or not.
dedicated to the price of treatment of various patients. the price of treatment depends on several factors: designation, form of clinic, town of residence, age then on.

### 4. What did we conclude?

  * First of all We concluded through the EDA what is the best location to work with soler energy.

#### After comparing the cities and their temperatures, and whether the cities were sunny or not, we found that the top three cities were as follows:
* Mecca
* Madina 
* Riyadh

  
  
  
* After That We Do Some Expermints to find best model, in this part we find models scores And it turned out that the best model is Random Forest.

### Random Forest is the best model
